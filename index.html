    <p>Now that it's all said and done
    I can't believe you were the one
    To build me up, then tear me down
    Like an old abandoned house
    And what you said when you left
    Just left me cold and out of breath
    I fell too far, was in way too deep
    Guess I let you get the best of me
    
    Well, I never saw it coming
    I shoulda started running
    A long, long time ago
    And I never thought I'd doubt you
    I'm better off without you
    More than you, more than you know
    I'm slowly getting closure
    I guess it's really over
    I'm finally getting better
    And now I'm picking up the pieces
    And spending all of these years
    Putting my heart back together
    'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
    I got over you

    And what you said when you left
    Just left me cold and out of breath
    I fell too far, was in way too deep
    Guess I let you get the best of me
    
    Well, I never saw it coming
    I shoulda started running
    A long, long time ago
    And I never thought I'd doubt you
    I'm better off without you
    More than you, more than you know
    I'm slowly getting closure
    I guess it's really over
    I'm finally getting better
    And now I'm picking up the pieces
    And spending all of these years
    Putting my heart back together
    'Cause the day I thought I'd never get through
    I got over you
